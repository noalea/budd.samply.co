INSTRUCTIONS

After downloading the folder make sure to extract it.

Before you begin, you need a text editor to open the files inside.
I recommend downloading Atom at https://atom.io/ .
Once you have Atom installed and running, go to File -> Open and then find the folder Budd and press Open.

Open up index.html, this is probably the only file you will ever need to touch.

Any gray text inside a <!-- ... --> is a comment to let you know how to edit the text and what it is for.

Move all the images you want to use into the 'images' folder first before changing it in 'index.html'.

If you ever want to change any styling like colors or sizing ask a friend who knows a little bit about this or send me an email and I'll get back to you as soon as I can!

Also once you are done editing your new site, you'll want to get it up online.

PS: Don't touch any other files and code UNLESS you know what you are doing.
